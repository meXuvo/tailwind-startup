# Tailwind CSS

A simple starter project for playing around with Tailwind in a proper PostCSS environment.

To get started:

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Using Yarn
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm run serve

   # Using Yarn
   yarn serve
   ```

   Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.

4. Open `public/index.html` in your editor and start experimenting!

## Building for production

```bash
# Using npm
npm run production

# Using Yarn
yarn production
```
